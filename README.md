# rust-concatenate-strings
Concatenate String using Rust

This Rust project demonstrates a simple string concatenation program.

The main goal is to concatenate two string slices and print the resulting string to the console.

The program showcases the use of Rust's string handling capabilities, particularly how to pass string references to a function and concatenate them.
